# GTNH Gradle plugin

This plugin is the container for most of our shared buildscript logic for all GTNH mods and some other 1.7.10 mods.
The original buildscript grew to hundreds of lines of Groovy code, using this plugin we can use regular Java classes to compartmentalize that logic and make it easier to extend and update.
